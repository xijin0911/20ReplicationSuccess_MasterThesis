GIT
===

- Pull whenever you start working

- Push only after your modifications produce a letigimate PDF

- If errors at pushing occur:
   - properly committed/
   - is another pull necessary? 

LaTeX
=====

- Have you opened the appropriate R project?
    (addresses errors like:  `Line 11: Undefined control sequence` or
                      `Missing \begin{document}` )
 
- Are additional R packages required?

- Check the output log to find the bug.

- Consult 'rules4latex.txt'.

knitr
=====

- No one knows all options: [https://yihui.name/knitr/options/]

- Keep very long computations offline.
